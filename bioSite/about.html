                        Melissa June is an Operating Room Nurse Manager currently working in a children's hospital in Central Florida. Melissa grew up in Connecticut with her mother, older brother, and father. Growing up she loved to be active and took a real liking to Volleyball. She played all throughout High School which eventually led her to play in college at Sacred Heart University. During her time at Sacred Heart, Melissa met her now Husband Michael who was also a student athlete who played soccer for the Pioneers. Melissa studied Psychology throughout her college years and went on to receive her Bachelors in Psychology. Post-grad she went on to working as an underwriter as she wasnâ€™t super passionate about psychology and was trying to work in something to pay the bills. Years later, and two daughters later, Melissa wanted to branch out into a new field and while working full time went back to school online to get her degree. At first her path led her to schooling in dental hygiene before she veered her way onto the nursing path. Working a full time job while raising two daughters who both play in competitive travel sports while also going to class and clinical rotations was by no means an easy feat. She persevered through the late nights and hard work to eventually become a registered nurse working in the pediatric OR. Since then she has gone back to school to receive her managerial nursing degree which is what she works as today.
